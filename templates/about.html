        Campus-Connect uses a simple upvote/downvote system to help students verify which 
        resources are trustworthy and up-to-date.
    </p>

    <ul class="about-text">
        <li><strong>Upvotes</strong> increase a resource’s credibility. Once a resource receives enough positive votes, it becomes marked as <em>Verified by the Community</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Downvotes</strong> signal that something may be inaccurate, outdated, or misleading.</li>
        <li>If a resource accumulates too many downvotes, its status changes to <em>Needs Review</em> or may be <em>Removed</em> from public view.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="about-text">
        This voting system ensures that the platform stays reliable and student-driven. 
        The community helps keep information accurate, safe, and useful for everyone.
